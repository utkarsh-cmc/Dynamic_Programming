# Dynamic_Programming
Dynamic programming is both a mathematical optimization method and a computer programming method. ... Likewise, in computer science, if a problem can be solved optimally by breaking it into sub-problems and then recursively finding the optimal solutions to the sub-problems, then it is said to have optimal substructure.
